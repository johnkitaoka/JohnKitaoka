 	   <p></br></br>Hi! My name is John Kitaoka.</br></br></p>

	<section class = "text">
		<p>I recently graduated with distinction from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in mathematics and computer science. There, I assisted select computer science and business courses as a teaching assistant, consulted with local small businesses to help manage their data, worked with a tech startup to revamp their digital footprint as part of a venture capital fellowship, and I was part of a small research group aiming to optimize a bus route for the City of Madison. </br></br></p>
		<p>Previously I interned at Amazon in 2020 as a newly-created role as a systems engineer, and the following summer I returned to Amazon again within AWS as a solutions architect intern. Needless to say, I'm coming back yet again in 2022 to start full-time as an associate solutions architect.</br></br></p>
