		<p>I'm a solutions architect at AWS specializing in machine learning and analytics. I also consult with small businesses to help them utlize their data.<br><br></p>
		<p>I graduated with the highest distinction from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2022 with a B.S. in mathematics and computer science. While at Wisconsin, I assisted a couple computer science and business courses as a teaching assistant, worked with a tech startup to revamp their digital footprint as part of a <a href = "https://creativedestructionlab.com/locations/wisconsin/">venture capital fellowship</a>, and I was part of a small research group aiming to <a href = "https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/documents/brt/brt-redundancies.pdf">optimize a transit system</a> for the City of Madison. I also played water polo and helped lead a few professional student <a href="https://www.wisconsinconsultingclub.org"> organizations</a>.</br></br></p>
		<p>Previously I interned at Amazon in 2020, working on expanding public land data access for ecologists, and the following summer I returned to Amazon again within AWS to work on a multipurpose relationship network for text data. Prior, I developed software and helped optimize business operations for a <a href = "https://geotek.com">manufacturing firm</a>.</br></br></p>
