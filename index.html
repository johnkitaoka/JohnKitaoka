  <p>Hi! My name is John Kitaoka.</p>
  <p>I'm a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison triple majoring in Finance (BBA), Information Systems (BBA), and Computer Science (BS).</p>
  <p>This site will be back up after I finish finals for this semester. Wish me luck!</p>
  <p>I'm currently a teaching assistant for <a href= "https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs301/fall19/schedule.html">Data Programming I</a> (CS301/CS220), as well as a member of a research group working with the city of Madison to analyze a proposed bus routing system. </p>
  <p>I've worked with a variety of different technologies, but my professional experience has primarily revolved around data analytics with Python/PANDAS, SQL, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. I'm also developing fully-functional websites for local companies (Rochester, MN) with Django framework and JS/Sqlite3 full stack.</p>
  <p>Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnkitaoka">LinkedIn</a>, and shoot me a message if there's anything I can do for you.</p>
  <p>Also, here's my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>. </p>
